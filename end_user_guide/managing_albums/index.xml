      <description>You may create a new photo album in one of two ways:
You may create a new topic on a channel you have permission to do so and share photos to create an album.
You may go to your profile and click on the MEDIA tab. There you will be given the option to add photos (or videos.) Choose the Add Photos link and you will be presented with the familiar editor and you can share photos as in other site posts.</description>

      <description>Video albums are not supported at this time. However if you go to your profile and click the MEDIA tab there will be a Videos album. If you click on the Videos album you will see a list of all videos you previously attached to posts on the site. This allows for a quick way for you or others to see the videos that you have shared in the past.</description>

      <description>In your list of photo albums you may see an album titled Posted Photos. This is a system generated container that includes all images posted in topics or other content and are not part of your specific albums.
The Posted Photos album is a good way to find old posted images and reshare them in new topics.

      <description>If you have previously uploaded a photo you may reuse it in a photo post or photo album without uploading it again.
Whether you are adding photos to a new album, an existing album, or to a new topic besides the Upload option you will also see a Select from Photo Album option. Click this button and you will be presented with a list of your photo albums on one side and the thumbnail images of photos from that album on the other side.</description>
