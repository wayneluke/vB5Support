However, there may be special cases where you need to download an older version. This dropdown will allow you to select from all currently available versions. Some versions in this list may no longer be supported and may be insecure. Use caution with this option. Additional Language\nSeveral other languages are supported in vBulletin. Selecting a language from this list will add it to your download and install it on your next upgrade. At this time, you can only install one additional language per download. PHP File Extension\nAs a general rule, web servers will use the default php extension for PHP scripts, but some servers may use a different extension, or you may simply wish to use a different extension out of your own preference. Various extensions are available here for you to choose. Download File Format\nThis option allows you to choose the compression format of the package you are about to download. Most people will want to download the zip package as WindowsÂ® has in-built support for zip files. However, if you are downloading the package directly to a Linux server you may prefer to use the tarball (tar.gz) format. CGI Shebang\nThis option will only be of use to you if your server runs PHP as a CGI rather than as a web server module. If your server runs PHP as a CGI and requires a shebang then you can enter the required text here and it will automatically be inserted into whichever PHP files in vBulletin require its use. This is rarely necessary on modern servers. Download File\nUse this option to control the contents of the package you are about to download. For example, if you have previously installed vBulletin you may not want to download the images again, so you can use this control to specify that the package you download does not contain the images directory. You can also download the uncompressed JavaScript package with this option. When you have set the download options that you wish to use, you can review and accept the License Agreement.

It's sometimes also called a 'board' or 'forums'. It may contain several categories, consisting of forums, topics and individual posts. The content on a community bulletin board is often created by the users or members of the site. They are used for support, to share ideas and for a variety of different topics.\nHow is all this structured?\rThe bulletin board as a whole contains various categories (broad subject areas), which themselves contain forums (more specific subject areas) which contain topics (conversations or discussions) which are made up of individual posts (where a user writes something).\nUsually the community home page has a list of categories and forums, with basic statistics for each - including the number of topics and posts, and which member posted the most recent message. This can be replaced with an activity stream which shows a stream of the latest posts, photos and other items shared.\nHow do I find my way around?\rWhen you click on a forum's name, you are taken to the list of topics it contains. A topic is a conversation between members or guests. Each topic starts out as a single post and grows as replies and comments are added by different users.\nTo start a new topic simply click on the + New Topic button (you may need the right permissions to do this).\nThreads can be ordered in many different ways. The default is to have the topic with the most recent activity at the top. But you can easily change this ordering, for example to have the topic with the most posts at the top. Simply click on Filter menu at the top right of the topic list. The Filter menu will provide you with the options you need to sort the current page\nMulti-page views\rWhen there are more topics to display than will fit on a single page, you may see the 'Page' box, which contains page numbers. This indicates that the list of topics has been split over two or more pages. This method of splitting lists of items over many pages is used throughout the community.\nWhat are sticky topics?\r'Sticky' topics are topics determined to be important by moderators or administrators. They are listed at the top of the topic list and remain 'stuck' to the top of the listing, even if they haven't had any posts recently. Their purpose is to keep important information visible and accessible at all times.\nHow do I read a topic?\rTo read a topic, click on its title. Each post in a topic is created by a member or a guest. You'll see some brief information about the member who created the topic to the left of post message.\nTo post a reply to an existing topic, click on the Post Reply button. If this button does not appear, it could mean that you are not logged in as a member, or that you do not have permission to reply, or that the topic has been closed to new replies.\nThere will also be a Reply box at the bottom of the page. This is where you can quickly enter a reply as well. If you click the Quote link on any reply, the content of that post will automatically be added to the Reply box for you. Clicking Quote on multiple posts allows you to multi-quote those posts in a single reply.\nHow do I find out more about members?\rTo view information about a particular member, click on the user name. This will take you to their public profile page.\nWhat is the Navigation Bar?\rThe navigation bar at the top of every page has links to help you move around. A 'breadcrumb' area at the top left shows where you are now. A form on the right allows you to quickly login. This allows quick movement from one section of the site to the other.\nCan I change the way the community looks?\rYou may be able to change the styling of the community by using the style changer in the bottom left of the page.

This page will display any news about vBulletin, action items that need to be handled, and information about your server configuration. It will also contain a quick method to search for users, phrases, PHP functions or MySQL language as well as some useful links, and the vBulletin credits. This area (the main content panel) is where the majority of your attention will be focused when administering your board.\nAt the top of the page is a tab bar with a link to the Site Home Page (the Frontend or User portion of your site). To the right of the tab bar are a series of links:\nReport Bug: Create an issue report for evaluation by the vBulletin Developers. If the issue is valid, it will be assigned to a future version for resolution. Get Support: Open a support ticket with vBulletin Support. Messages: This links to your Message Center on the frontend. In the Message Center you can reply to private messages, handle notifications, and approve moderated posts. Log out: Ends your AdminCP session. Directly below the open Admin CP tab is a narrow strip that contains information about the vBulletin version you are currently running and the latest version available to download. Warning indicators will appear if your site is in Debug Mode and/or is turned off. To the right of the strip is a search box allowing you to search the AdminCP.\nNavigation Menu To the left of the AdminCP page is the navigation panel. This long, thin area is the key to getting around the Admin CP.\nWhen you first visit the Admin CP, you will notice that all the sections of this panel are in a collapsed state.\nYou can click the arrow on each section to expand it and show its contents, and click the arrow again to collapse that section again. Double-clicking a section\u0026rsquo;s title will also toggle its state and either expand or contract it. When you have a section or sections expanded, different command pages will appear as links. Selecting a page will load it in the main content panel.\nYou can expand and collapse sections to build a customized control panel layout for yourself. For example, you may find that you regularly use the \u0026lsquo;Styles\u0026rsquo; tools, but very infrequently use the Help (User Manual) manager.\nWhen you have established a set of expanded and collapsed sections that suits your way of working, you can save the state of the sections by clicking on [button]Save Prefs[/button].

Here are some things to consider when upgrading:\nSome functionality may have been deprecated and not will not be carried forward. Data structures are completely different. The vBulletin 5 Connect upgrade script will upgrade your existing data to the new format. After this is completed, there is no way to revert to an older version. Styles from previous versions are not compatible. Any customizations will need to be reapplied. If you use a custom color palette, you should write down the color codes and where each color is used so they can be reapplied. Addon Products, Hooks, and most Template modifications from older versions will not be applicable in vBulletin 5 Connect. These will need to be re-coded to work in the current system. Empty Directory If you look at the upload directory of your vBulletin Package, you will see that the file structure for vBulletin Connect is different than the file structure for legacy versions. vBulletin 5 needs to be installed in an empty directory without the legacy files present. If you store attachments and/or custom avatars within the file system, you will want to restore these directories after uploading the vBulletin 5 file structure.\nQuestions to Ask Have you installed any plugins or products? If so, the first thing that you will need to decide is âIs this critical to my site?â If the answer is yes, you will first need to check that a vB5 compatible version of the modification is available, either at www.vbulletin.org or via the authorâs own site. If the answer is no, then you need take no action as vBulletin 5âs new API system means that any existing plugins and products wonât work - however after you upgrade, it would be good practice to make sure you remove any files required by these. vBulletin 5âs template code has been rewritten from scratch so existing themes/styles from vB4 will not work with it. As with plugins and products, if youâre looking to retain a similar look and feel to your site or simply donât wish to use the default style after upgrading, you will need to do one of three things: Contact the style designer to see if theyâve already created a vB5 compatible version of the style. Download and install a new vB5 compatible style from www.vbulletin.org or another supplier or Create a test installation of vB5 and create your own unique style from scratch Variables used within templates may have changed. This means that any variable reference in vBulletin markup will need to be updated. Are you running a big board? We know that upgrading a big board can be complicated and has its own set of issues. Please upgrade a test version of your site first. Do you use a custom .htaccess file on your site? As vBulletin 5 comes with URL Rewrites as standard, it includes an .htaccess by default. Uploading the files for the upgrade will see your custom .htaccess file overwritten losing any custom code that you had within the file (URL Rewrites, specific filetype caching). Make sure you have a backup of your .htaccess file before proceeding with the upgrade then you can look to merge the contents of your custom file and the vBulletin 5 default file after upgrading. Frequently Asked Questions Can I make my URLs look like vBSEO? : No, this is not possible in vBulletin 5. It comes with its own URL and route structure. The person who created my custom style isn\u0026rsquo;t available to upgrade it. Can you do this for me? : No, we do not perform customizations. vBulletin 5 Connect comes with a number of themes when it is installed. You can use one of these until you perform your customizations. Can I install this software in a test installation? : Yes. This is the recoommended process.

The system should automatically extract the package for you into its own folder.\nWhen the extraction complete, you will find that inside of the new folder there are two other folders called upload and another called do_not_upload.\nupload - This folder contains the vBulletin files that need to be uploaded to your web server.\nUploading vBulletin to your Server After your config.php file has been edited and saved it is time to upload the vBulletin scripts to your web server ready for installation. The uploading process should be familiar to anyone who has published pages to a web site before, but a brief description of the process is given here.\nAlthough there are several methods available to transfer the vBulletin files from your computer to your web server, by far the most common method in use is transfer via FTP. Most operating systems have built-in tools for opening FTP connections although they are often limited in their usefulness and many people opt to use a third party FTP client application. For this example we will use FileZilla.\nThe web root is usually called public_html, www or htdocs and is located within your home directory. If you are unsure of where to find your own web publishing folder, your host will be able to help you.\nExample 1: Installing at the Domain Root To install at the root level of your site, you can upload all the files contained in the upload folder directly into the web root on the server. This will bring your visitors directly to the vBulletin site when they visit your website.\nUsing FileZilla we do this by dragging the contents of the upload folder from its location on your computer\u0026rsquo;s hard disk to the web root on the server.\nIf all has gone well, you are now ready to run the installation script to prepare your database to run vBulletin.\nExample 2: Installing in a Sub-Directory Installing in a sub-directory is useful if you have a pre-existing website. Using FileZilla we do this by dragging the upload folder from its location on your computer\u0026rsquo;s hard disk to the web publishing folder on the server.\nWhen all the files have been uploaded successfully you should rename the upload folder on the web server to the name you want to use for your forums directory. We will be calling it forums for the purposes of this manual.\nNote: You will have to set the Rewrite Base directive in your .htaccess file to allow vBulletin to work correctly in a sub-directory.\nExample 3: Utilizing cPanel ###Notes about using FTP Clients\nMost FTP client applications will handle the file transfers automatically, but if for some reason your application does not, you should make a note of the following:\nAll text files to be transferred in ASCII mode All files containing plain text from the vBulletin package should be transferred in ASCII mode. Text file types you will find in vBulletin are: .html, .php, .js, .xml, .css. All non-text files to be transferred in Binary mode. Binary file types used in vBulletin are: .gif, .png, .jpg, .ico.

Stylevars are used in conjunction with CSS and Templates to control the look and feel of your vBulletin site.\nHow Style Variables Interact with CSS vBulletin uses Style Variables to dynamically build the CSS it uses for rendering during page load or when the files are written to the server, if you have enabled that option.\nStyleVars are incorporated into CSS and Templates using the {vb:stylevar} syntax.\nWhile Stylevars are primarily used within CSS in vBulletin, they can be used in HTML templates as well.\nHere is a sample of code in a CSS template:\n.b-userinfo { text-align: center; color: {vb:stylevar post_user_info_color}; padding: 15px 15px 10px; } .b-userinfo--pmchat { display: inline-block; } .b-userinfo__rank { /* TODO: is this really the stylevar we want to use? */ color: {vb:stylevar post_controls_text_color}; } .b-userinfo__icons { position: absolute; bottom: 10px; {vb:stylevar left}: 10px; } This code contains several style variable references denoted by {vb:stylevar} tags. The vBulletin template engine retrieves the values of the style variables and inserts them directly into the CSS before it is used for rendering.\nCSS Math Tag It is possible to use style variables in mathematical expressions with the {vb:math} tag.\nThis is used to evaluate the result of the mathematical expression specified. The syntax is {vb:math expression}.\nAn example using {vb:math} is:\nheight:{vb:math 8px + {vb:math {vb:stylevar font.fontSize}-1}}; This expression determines the height of an element based on the font size specified in the font style variable and an extra value of 8 pixels.\n"},{"id":47,"href":"/end_user_guide/bbcode_reference/using-quotes/","title":"Using Quotes","parent":"BB Code Reference","content":"Quotes are a great way to maintain continuity in long conversations.

While in the case of bug fixes, the need to upgrade quickly is understandable, too often people donât consider what effect an upgrade will have on their site. The following is aimed at providing enough knowledge to be able to create a test \u0026lsquo;mirror\u0026rsquo; of a site so that a test of an upgrade (or any change for that matter!) can be made.\nStep 1 - Update URLs and Backup your database! An all important step in any upgrade but without it, you\u0026rsquo;ll never be able to test an upgrade - period! As you\u0026rsquo;re going to be moving your database to be read by software on a different URL, you need to make sure you update the database to reflect this. There are two ways to do this:\nUpdate the URLs before backing up the database or Update manually in the database after backing up (NOT RECOMMENDED) To update the URLs before backing up, follow these simple steps:\nClose your site via AdminCP \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Options \u0026gt; Turn Your vBulletin On and Off Update the URLs at AdminCP \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Options \u0026gt; Site Name / URL / Contact Details Warning: ***DO NOT CLOSE YOUR BROWSER AFTER THE ABOVE STEP*** Backup your database (see below) Update the URLs at AdminCP \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Options \u0026gt; Site Name / URL / Contact Details back to your live URLs Reopen your site via AdminCP \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Options \u0026gt; Turn Your vBulletin On and Off This will give you a ready made backup that will require no manual intervention to ensure that it\u0026rsquo;s ready for testing against.\nThere are a number of ways to backup your database. The most reliable method of backing up and restoring a database is with shell access via ssh. This is because backing up with a PHP script like phpMyAdmin can result in PHP timeouts errors and an incomplete backup file. For more information on how to do this, please see the instructions here:\nBackup: http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/maintenance_ssh_backup\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have shell access, some people have also reported success with these scripts:\nMySQLDumper: http://www.mysqldumper.de/en/index.php\nMySQLHotcopy: http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/showthread.php?t=134821\u0026highlight=mysqlhotcopy\nBigdump: http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump.php\nOnce you have your backup, you need to actually restore it to be able to test against it.\nStep 2 - Restore your database There\u0026rsquo;s two options here depending on the hosting package you have:\nCreate a new database and restore to it or Restore into your live database Option 1, if you have more than 1 database available to you, is the option we\u0026rsquo;d recommend in every case because quite simply, it\u0026rsquo;s the safest! That said, some hosting plans, particularly lower costed shared plans, may only allow a user 1 database so you may have no choice but to go with option 2!\nOption 1 - Create a new database and restore to it\nThis is the safest way to go. From your server\u0026rsquo;s control panel, create a new database then restore your freshly backed up database into this new database. As this is a completely separate database to your live one (different database name and hopefully different login details), there will be no need to manipulate the database prior to using it.\nOption 2 - Restore into your live database\nWhile this is NOT recommended, there are a number of users who will simply have to go down this route due to the lack of features with the hosting package they have (or can afford). Before doing this, make sure you read these steps BEFORE attempting to do the restore.\nTo do these, you will need to have a text editor installed. Windows users will have Notepad and Wordpad, Mac users may have TextEdit. I\u0026rsquo;ve used Wordpad without issue - and it\u0026rsquo;s Find and Replace tool will be needed for the following steps as you will need these to manipulate the database backup before restoring it but don\u0026rsquo;t worry - it\u0026rsquo;s not complicated as you\u0026rsquo;ll see\u0026hellip;\na. Table prefixes\nWhether you have prefixes or not, you are going to need to create a prefix to distinguish your test database from your live one. The following shows a table with no prefix then one with a prefix of \u0026lsquo;vb_\u0026rsquo; - the rest of this entry will assume that prefix is currently used:\nNo Prefix:\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS access; CREATE TABLE access ( userid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default \u0026lsquo;0\u0026rsquo;, forumid smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL default \u0026lsquo;0\u0026rsquo;, accessmask smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL default \u0026lsquo;0\u0026rsquo;, PRIMARY KEY (userid,forumid) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;\nWith Prefix:\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS vb_access; CREATE TABLE vb_access ( userid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default \u0026lsquo;0\u0026rsquo;, forumid smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL default \u0026lsquo;0\u0026rsquo;, accessmask smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL default \u0026lsquo;0\u0026rsquo;, PRIMARY KEY (userid,forumid) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;\nTo ensure your test database is unique, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to add/change the prefix depending on what you currently have in place. Using the \u0026lsquo;Find and Replace\u0026rsquo; option in your editor, you can add/change the prefix very easily (note if you have no prefix you will need to do this twice - once to edit the \u0026lsquo;Drop\u0026rsquo; command, once for the \u0026lsquo;Create\u0026rsquo; one):\nOnce, you hit OK/Replace All or whatever command your editor has, this will go through and add/replace prefixes on all tables. Now save this file under a different name on your local machine.\nNow that you have your edited database, upload this to your server then restore it. For more instructions on using ssh, see this section of the manual:\nhttp://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/maintenance_ssh_restore\nThis will create a new set of duplicate database tables within their own \u0026lsquo;group\u0026rsquo; thanks to the amended prefix.\nStep 3 - Files So, you\u0026rsquo;ve got your database in place so all we need is to upload the files - right? Nearly! Yes, you will need to have an actual installation of vBulletin on your server to use these but it\u0026rsquo;s not just a case of uploading the files and away you go - so read on and follow\u0026hellip;\nFirst thing\u0026rsquo;s first, create a new empty directory on your server called \u0026rsquo;testvb\u0026rsquo;. You will need to protect this directory from the general public. The most common way to do this is by a combination of .htaccess and .htpasswd files. For more on these and assistance in setting these up, go to:\nhttp://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/\nSome Windows Server users may find that this doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for them in which case you should use the permissions tools available on the server\nNext, you need to decide what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Are you testing some changes to the templates etc. without upgrading or are you testing an upgrade?\nTesting changes If you\u0026rsquo;re only testing some changes you want to make to the site (new styles, template changes) then either copy your live site\u0026rsquo;s files to the \u0026rsquo;testvb\u0026rsquo; directory or download a copy of your live site and then upload them into the \u0026rsquo;testvb\u0026rsquo; directory.\nTesting an upgrade If you\u0026rsquo;re testing an upgrade, then there\u0026rsquo;s no need to copy your live site\u0026rsquo;s files as you\u0026rsquo;re only going to be overwriting them with the newer ones anyway! In this instance, simply download the new files from the Members Area and upload these to your \u0026rsquo;testvb\u0026rsquo; directory.\nconfig.php VERY IMPORTANT STEP! I highlight this as without this step, you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing whatever you do to your live database!\nOpen config.php in your normal web editor. Again, this will vary slightly depending on whether you\u0026rsquo;re using a different database or whether you\u0026rsquo;re having to use different prefixed tables in the same one.\na. Imported Database to a new database\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve got the luxury of using a completely separate database, then you will need to edit the following details to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re pointing to the correct one:\nDatabase Name Database Username Database Password Cookie Prefix b. Imported Database to different prefixed tables in live database\nThis is even more important in this scenario. You need to edit the following areas:\nDatabase Table Prefix Cookie Prefix Why edit the cookie prefix? If you\u0026rsquo;re using the same Cookie prefix on your test site as you do on your live site, your browser won\u0026rsquo;t distinguish which site you\u0026rsquo;re actually viewing as they\u0026rsquo;re both on the same domain. This will cause problems when logging in and doing anything where your personal settings are saved in a Cookie. The easiest way to distinguish these is to change the test site\u0026rsquo;s value to \u0026lsquo;vbtest\u0026rsquo;.\nRegardless of which method of database import you\u0026rsquo;ve had to do, you should add the following to the top of the config.php file, right under \u0026lt;?php:\ndefine(\u0026lsquo;DISABLE_MAIL\u0026rsquo;, 1);\nThis will stop the vBulletin email system from sending mails to users on their birthdays, if you add a test post to a subscribed thread etc. The last thing you want is users emailing you to say they\u0026rsquo;ve had a notification from a strange URL that looks like it could be your site\u0026hellip;\nStep 4 - AdminCP Almost there! There are a couple of small changes that you will need to make to ensure that things run smoothly! Firstly, we need to make sure all links point to the right directory. So, login to the AdminCP in your testing directory and go to:\nSettings â Options â Site URL \u0026amp; Routing\nand make sure the Forum URL is pointing to your \u0026rsquo;testvb\u0026rsquo; directory. Also, under the following section, ensure that the \u0026lsquo;Path to Save Cookies\u0026rsquo; setting is set to /testvb/:\nSettings â Options â Cookies and HTTP Header Options\nAnd finally, you can also (optionally!) turn off Scheduled Tasks but given that you\u0026rsquo;ve disabled the mail system via the config.php file, it would provide benefit to leave this enabled.\n"},{"id":50,"href":"/end_user_guide/creating_content/advanced-editing-using-bbcode/","title":"Advanced Editing (using BBCode)","parent":"Creating Content","content":"When posting messages you may wish to include some formatting such as bold text, italic text or underline text.\nAdding formatting to a post can be done in either of two ways:\nUsing clickable buttons in the Advanced editor similar to those found in word processors\rTyping in BB Codes around text manually\rClickable buttons are available in the Advanced editor.

This differs from the normal upgrade routine so this short article will clarify exactly what needs to be done when we announce a Patch Level (PL) release.\nA patch level release contains fixes for only the most critical issues in the previous release. In most cases, these are released to address a security issue. However they can be released for data integrity issues as well.\nA patch level is designed to be installed directly over top of your existing installation, with no other action. You do not need to run any upgrade scripts.\nDownload The Patch A Patch Level release doesn\u0026rsquo;t come as a full set of files. As such, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear in the normal download location. To access the Patch Release, first login to the vBulletin Members Area. In the left hand navigation within the \u0026lsquo;Support Services\u0026rsquo; section, click on the Patches/Security Patches link and you will see a screen showing all Patch Level releases for your Licenses.\nPatch Packages are cumulative so you only need the latest one available for your version. You cannot use a Patch to upgrade your site.\nSimply click on the Patch for the version you\u0026rsquo;re currently running and you will be taken to the download page, where you will be given options for how to download the Patch. The following options are available via the \u0026lsquo;More Download Options\u0026rsquo; radio button should you need to change these before downloading the ZIP file (in the majority of cases, these will not need to be altered):\nPHP File Extension - As a general rule, web servers will use .php as the extension for PHP scripts, but some servers may use a different extension, or you may simply wish to use a different extension out of your own preference. Various extensions are available here for you to choose. Download File Format - This option allows you to choose the compression format of the package you are about to download. Most people will want to download the .zip package as WindowsÂ® has built-in support for zip files. However, if you are downloading the package directly to a Linux server you may prefer to use the tarball (.tar.gz) format. CGI Shebang - This option will only be of use to you if your server runs PHP as a CGI rather than as a web server module. If your server runs PHP as a CGI and requires a shebang (such as #!/usr/bin/php) then you can enter the required text here and it will automatically be inserted into whichever PHP files in vBulletin require its use. When you have set the download options you can click the Download button to start the download. When the download prompt window appears, you should choose the Save option and choose a directory on your computer in which to save the package.\nUpdating Files On Your Server With Patch Level releases, the preparation work is very small - simply extract the ZIP package to your local machine! Once you\u0026rsquo;ve done this, you will notice that there is no upload folder. A Patch Level release only contains the files that are being fixed so will not see a complete installation package\nBefore you do this you should close your forums. This will help eliminate any potential db errors as people attempt to access your forums before the upgrade is complete.\nIt will also be a good idea at this point to take a backup of your site and database. While the database won\u0026rsquo;t be updated with a Patch Level release, it\u0026rsquo;s useful to have an up-to-date backup in any case. For more information on backing up your database, please see this section of the Online Manual.\nConnect to your FTP server using your FTP client of choice. Select the Patch Level files in the local pane and open the existing old files in the remote pane, then drag the new folders/files to the remote window.\nYou will most likely be prompted by the FTP client at this point to ask if you want to overwrite the existing files. You should confirm this prompt, telling the FTP client that yes, you do want to overwrite the existing files. If the prompt gives you the option to overwrite all existing files without prompting again, use this option.\nOnce the files are uploaded, that\u0026rsquo;s your installation patched! There are no scripts to run and you can re-open your forums to users again.\nThis is not a full upgrade. You do not need to run any upgrade scripts to complete the upgrade.\n"},{"id":61,"href":"/end_user_guide/managing_account/can-i-use-images-in-my-signature/","title":"Can I use images in my signature?","parent":"Managing Your Account","content":"It is up to the Administrator whether you may use images in your signature.

If you do not manage your own server, you can ask your server administrator or hosting provider to do this for you. Sometimes, the hosting provider will support multiple versions of PHP. We recommend using the latest version available. If they say that you\u0026rsquo;re using a version higher than PHP {{ site.vbulletin.php_version }}, then ask them if you need to \u0026ldquo;add a handler for that version\u0026rdquo;. Follow their instructions.\nI installed vBulletin but there is no formatting If after installation your vBulletin looks like a plain white page with no formatting and none of the links are working, this means that URL Rewriting is not operational. To fix this choose the appropriate step.\nApache If you\u0026rsquo;re on a Apache powered webserver, you will need to rename htaccess.txt to .htaccess. If the above doesn\u0026rsquo;t fix it, make sure the AllowOverride directive is set to all in Apache\u0026rsquo;s httpd.conf file. You may need to talk to your hosting provider about this. Apache will need to be restarted for any changes to this file to take affect. If you have vBulletin installed in a sub-directory, find the line following section of your .htacces file and change it to fit your installation. # In some cases where you have other mod_rewrite rules, you may need to remove the comment on the following # line and change it to match your folder name. This resets the other mod_rewrite rules for just this directory # If your site was www.example.com/forum, the setting would be /forum/ #RewriteBase / Windows Make sure that the URL Rewrite module from Microsoft is installed for IIS. The module needs to be available for your vBulletin application pool. Make sure the web.config file in your vBulletin root directory is uploaded. Verify that rewrites are working in the IIS Manager Console by navigating to the vBulletin application pool and checking the rewrites under URL Rewrite.

For example, if you are telling a joke or being sarcastic you may wish to add a wink instead of writing 'this is a joke'.\nThe basic smilies are the same as what you would find on any instant messenger system.

Chances are that your host makes regular backups but these tend to be difficult for partial restores. They may also provide tools to create database backups on demand. Discuss database backups with your host. If this is not available, then you will want to use the instructions below to make regular backups. Store these on your local workstation or in a Cloud Storage system.\nvBulletin Cloud The vBulletin Cloud system makes a daily backup for each individual site. These can be restored by contacting support. In addition to this, you can request a backup at any time in your Member\u0026rsquo;s Area\nvBulletin Connect Download Manual Backup In order to back up your database via SSH you will require 2 things:\nSSH access to your site. You will need to check with your hosting company to see if this is available. An SSH client. Most OSes have a command line SSH command. If you are not comfortable with the command line, you will nee an application such as PuTTy. Open your SSH client and log into your website. The command line prompt you will see will vary by OS.\nFor most hosting companies, this will bring you into your account\u0026rsquo;s home folder.\nLocal MySQL Type in the following to create a backup in the current directory:\nmysqldump --opt -Q -u dbusername -p databasename \u0026gt; backupname.sql\nOr to create a backup in a separate directory (signified by /path/to/) type:\nmysqldump --opt -Q -u dbusername -p databasename \u0026gt; /path/to/backupname.sql\nYou will be prompted for the database password. Enter it and the database will backup.\nRemote MySQL If your hosting company has you on a remote MySQL server, such as mysql.yourhost.com, you will need to add the servername to the command line. The servername will be the same as in your config.php. The command line will be:\nCurrent directory:\nmysqldump --opt -Q -h servername -u dbusername -p databasename \u0026gt; backupname.sql\nSeparate directory:\nmysqldump --opt -Q -h servername -u dbusername -p databasename \u0026gt; /path/to/backupname.sql\nStorage You can then download the backup file to your home computer. You can also create a directory on the server to store multiple backups. However, it is recommended that you maintain latest backup in a location other than your web server.\nYou can also ZIP or GZIP your backup file before storing it. Ask your host for help with this functionality.\nAutomatic Backups The vBulletin 5.X download includes a bash script to automate the backup process. This script can be found in the do_not_upload folder.\nOn most servers, this script will create backups with the filename format of %dbname%-%day%-%month%-%year%.gz. This will allow you to keep multiple backups of your database.\nOnce configured, you can execute this script via the command line. However, to get the most use out of it, the server should be configured to run it automatically at a set interval.\nUploading the backup script On the server machine, switch to your home directory. If necessary, create a new subdirectory called \u0026ldquo;backups\u0026rdquo;. Then upload/copy the script into this directory using SFTP, SCP, or SSH.\ncd ~ mkdir backups cd backups Configure vb_backup.sh Inside the file there is one variable that needs to be updated for configuration:\n# Please change this variable to the path to your config.php path_to_config=\u0026#34;/home/example/htdocs/core/includes/config.php\u0026#34; Update the path between the quotes to point to your Core Config file (core/includes/config.php).\nIf your server does not include the paths to mysqldump and gzip within the PATH server environment, you can specify these in the script as well.\n# If you need the full path to the mysqldump binaries or gzip binaries set below mysqldumpcmd=mysqldump gzipcmd=gzip If neceassary, update the path on the right for each command.\nOnce this is done, you can upload the file to your user\u0026rsquo;s home directory on the server.\nThis file should not be placed in the public_html or htdocs directories.\nPermissions Once the server is uploaded to your web server, it needs to have permission to be executed. On linux the command to do this would be:\nchmod +x vb_backup.sh\nThis will allow the server to process the commands in the script.\nRunning the script You can run this script from the command line with this command:\n~\\backups\\vb_backup.sh\nIf you wish to run this script automatically, you will need to configure the task scheduling tool on your server to invoke it. For example using crontab on a Linux system. Consult the manual/documentation for your server\u0026rsquo;s operating system for help on doing this.\nExample crontab configuration to run the script daily at 23:00 hours:\n0 23 * * * ~/backups/vb_backup.sh "},{"id":69,"href":"/administration/site_builder/header/","title":"Header","parent":"Site Builder","content":"The Header appears on every page just above the Navigation Bar.

For many people this can be the most convenient way of exploring the site, as it aggregates all recent activity in one place.\nTODAY'S POSTS is usually shown only to guests (unregistered users browsing the site), and provides a simple but comprehensive list of all content that has been updated in the past 24 hours. Topics with unread content are highlighted in bold text; topics with no new content since the last visit are displayed in normal (non-bold) text.\nNEW TOPICS is usually shown only to logged in users, and works in much the same way as Today's posts, except that it only shows topics with unread content since the member's last visit to the site. Topics will generally only show up in bold text, as once the item has been read it is no longer \"New\" and therefore does not display in \"New Topics\" at all.\nIn both cases; logged in members will see a small icon immediately to the left of the title in the case of unread topics; clicking this icon will take the member to the first unread item in the topic. Clicking the title itself will open the topic at the first item.\nEach entry in the list also shows the following information:\nThe topic title\rA read / unread icon that indicates whether the topic contains unread content\rA small icon that links directly to the first unread item in the topic (if the topic contains unread content)\rName of person who started the topic\rDate and time the topic was started\rAny Topic prefix associated with the topic. Clicking on the prefix will show you other topics with this prefix\rTotal number of posts in the topic\rTotal number of likes within the topic\rName and avatar of the last person to post to the topic\rDate and time of the last post to the topic.\rAdditionally, at the top of the list of topics, there are two filters that enable the viewer to sort the results according to their requirements.\nActivity Stream\rThe Activity Stream forms an integral part of new content discovery on the site. It can be configured to be visible, or even to be the default view, in a number of areas of the site, such as: Forums, Blogs, Groups, Topics and Discussions.\nThe idea of an Activity Stream is to provide a \"running commentary\" of activity in that particular section of the site, or even the entire site if required.\nA straightforward example of an Activity Stream view would be the main Forum listing. At the top of the list of forums are a series of tabs; the second of these is labelled \"Latest Activity\". Clicking this tab transforms the view of the forums from a straightforward list, to a free flowing commentary of recent activity. This will commonly consist of new topics started, replies to existing topics, and the addition of other content such as photos. Each \"entry\" in the stream also makes clear who posted the content, and where and when.\nActivity Streams appear in other places as well. These include Groups and Blogs, and even in topics themselves, where the list of posts can be displayed in stream view to provide a commentary of activity specific to that topic.\nModules with Activity Streams, such as the Forum Home module or Group Home module, can be configured by the administrator to display content using certain criteria by default, though end users can apply different filters if they choose. End users can change the filter on specific streams to show the results they are looking for, such as specific content types or time frames.\nupdated: 2021-10-06 01:30pm | Version: 5.6.5 Alpha 11 "},{"id":80,"href":"/administration/site_builder/footer/","title":"Footer","parent":"Site Builder","content":" What is the Footer?

Nearly any computer language can be used to communicate over HTTP with the REST server.\nNote that [[#api.php|api.php]] is located in your vB core base URL, not in the presentation layer.\nAPI Method Names and Legacy Actions Mapping Each API method can be mapped to an action of a vB Web API.\nMethod Name: \u0026lt;classname\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;functionname\u0026gt;\nis mapped to Web API: vB_Api_Classname::functionname().\nEg.: [[VB5_API:node.getNode|node.getNode]] is mapped to Web API: vB_Api_Node::getNode().\n[[VB5_API:user.login|user.login]] is mapped to Web API: vB_Api_User::login().\nAPI Method Parameters An API Method may accept two types of parameters: GET and POST. GET parameters should be passed via HTTP GET; POST parameters should be passed via HTTP POST. Both GET and POST parameters will be merged and used as the API parameters.\nFor example, the definition of vB_Api_User::fetchUserinfo() is\npublic function fetchUserinfo($userid = false, $option = array(), $languageid = 0, $nocache = false)\nIf you pass GET[\u0026lsquo;userid\u0026rsquo;] =\u0026gt; 1, POST[\u0026lsquo;option\u0026rsquo;] =\u0026gt; array(FetchUserinfoOptions) to [[VB5_API:user.fetchUserinfo|user.fetchUserinfo]], the following Web API will be called with the parameters:\nvB_Api_User::fetchUserinfo(1, array(FetchUserinfoOptions))\nNote that the keys \u0026lsquo;userid\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;option\u0026rsquo; match the parameter names in the API definition.\nThe parameters which don\u0026rsquo;t match Web API defined parameter names will be ignored.\nAll parameters should be encoded into UTF-8 charset.\nAPI Response All API methods return JSON data to the clients. JSON objects ({}) and arrays ([]) are all treated as arrays.\nAll values are encoded into Unicode/UTF-8.\nNote, for any response including the \u0026ldquo;postbits\u0026rdquo; block, vBulletin 5 may contain additional information related to the new vB5 content types. Please see [[VB5_API_Common_Array:Postbits_Array|this link]] for these additional elements.\nConcept ClientID and Secret ClientID is required for each API call (except calling [[VB5_API:api.init|api.init]] for the first time). It\u0026rsquo;s used for identify the client itself.\nSecret is used for generating API signature and validating API response. A client will get a secret by calling [[VB5_API:api.init|api.init]] for the first time. It should store the secret safely and never pass it through the network.\nAccess Token Access Token is required for each API call (except calling [[VB5_API:api.init|api.init]] for the first time). It\u0026rsquo;s used for authenticating user and granting correct permission to logged-in user. A client can call [[VB5_API:api.init|api.init]] to get a new or existing access token. The client should store it for further usage.\nAfter a user is logged out (with [[VB5_API:user.logout|user.logout]] method), a new access token will be generated to identify the guest. The client should then update the access token it stores for further usage.\nAPI Key API Key is an random string to prevent unauthorized clients to connect to vBulletin. Forum administrator can get or generate its API Key in vBulletin\u0026rsquo;s AdminCP.\nAPI Key is mainly used for [[#API Method Request and Return Result Verification|API Method Request and Return Result Verification]].\napi_init [[VB5_API:api.init|api.init]] is the first method of the API that a client should call. Client should pass its name, version and other information to the method. Then the method will return information of vBulletin and the API, such as vBulletin version, URL and API version. Also it will return [[#Access Token|Access Token]], [[#ClientID and Secret|ClientID]] and [[#ClientID and Secret|Secret]] to the client.\nAPI Method Request and Return Result Verification Each API request (except [[VB5_API:api.init|api.init]]) should be signed to make sure that the requests to different API methods in a session are made by and come from one same client. Also the results returned by different API methods are signed to make sure that they were returned from the same vBulletin site.\nHow to sign a request (in PHP):\n// The HTTP GET params for an API method // (without api related params except api_m. see below) $requestparams = array(\u0026#39;api_m\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;node.getNode\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;value1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;value2\u0026#39;); // Sort GET params by key ksort($requestparams); // $signstr = \u0026#39;a=value2\u0026amp;api_m=forumdisplay\u0026amp;b=value1\u0026#39;; $signstr = http_build_query($requestparams); // The correct signature is the md5 value of $data + accesstoken + clientid + secret + apikey // (all can be fetched from api_init except apikey // -- this is a value specific to the vB site you are trying to connect to and can be found in the admincp) $sign = md5($signstr.$apiaccesstoken.$apiclientid.$secret); Note: Signature is the md5 hash of a string which is made up with HTTP GET parameter string, [[#Access Token|Access Token]], [[#ClientID and Secret|ClientID]] and [[#ClientID and Secret|Secret]]. HTTP GET parameter string contains HTTP GET parameters only in Query String format and the parameters names are in alphabet order.\nHow to verify a result (in PHP):\n// The sign value returned by the server (Authorization header); $sign = $_SERVER[\u0026#39;HTTP_AUTHORIZATION\u0026#39;]; $data = \u0026#39;the raw JSON data returned by the server\u0026#39;; // The correct signature is the md5 value of $data + accesstoken + clientid + secret (all can be fetched from api_init) $signtoverify = md5($data.$apiaccesstoken.$apiclientid.$secret); if ($sign != $signtoverify) { // Throw error msg here } Note: Every response returned by API method contains a HTTP Header named HTTP_AUTHORIZATION. The client should calculate a verification string to be compared with the value of HTTP_AUTHORIZATION header. The verification string is a md5 value of a string which is made up with RAW JSON data returned by the server, [[#Access Token|Access Token]], [[#ClientID and Secret|ClientID]] and [[#ClientID and Secret|Secret]]. The client should verify each response returned by the server.\napi.php api.php is a central entry script for all clients to load. It handles all GET, POST requests and HTTP headers (For authentication / requests validation etc.) from client. It also takes charge of translating method name to vBulletin URL and actually requests to the URL.\nMethod name is required by api.php either via HTTP GET or POST. Also most of the methods require [[#Access Token|Access Token]] and [[#API Method Request and Return Result Verification|Signature]].\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s an example of the request URL:\n\u0026lsquo;\u0026rsquo;http://www.yourforumcorebaseurl.com/api.php?api_m=node.getNode\u0026amp;api_c=clientid\u0026amp;api_s=accesstoken\u0026amp;api_sig=signature\u0026amp;api_v=3\u0026amp;b=value1\u0026amp;a=value2\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;\nFrom the example, you\u0026rsquo;ll see:\napi.php - the entry script name. api_m - API method name. In this example, it\u0026rsquo;s [[VB5_API:node.getNode|node.getNode]]. api_c - [[#ClientID and Secret|ClientID]]. api_s - [[#Access Token|Access Token]]. api_sig - [[#API Method Request and Return Result Verification|Signature]] of the request api_v - the api version called by the request b=value1\u0026amp;a=value2 - the HTTP GET parameters accepted by the method ([[VB5_API:node.getNode|node.getNode]]) of the API Error Handling Client should always check the existence of errors of every API method response to see if there are any errors before further processing.\nerrors is an array. Its first item is always an unique error ID (underlying it\u0026rsquo;s actually the error message phrase name). Other items are parameters coupled with the error. An example errormessage for invalid nodeid:\n\u0026#34;errors\u0026#34;: [ [ \u0026#34;invalid_node_id\u0026#34; ] ], \u0026#34;debug\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;API Error\u0026lt;\\/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Error:\u0026lt;\\/b\u0026gt; invalid_node_id\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } The client must check the following errors for each call of all methods (except [[VB5_API:api.init|api.init]]):\n*invalid_clientid - The [[#ClientID_and_Secret|ClientID]] ([[#api.php|api_c]]) passed from the client is no longer valid. Solution: Call [[VB4 API:api init|api_init]] (without [[#api.php|api_c]] parameter) to get a new [[#ClientID_and_Secret|ClientID]], [[#Access_Token|Access Token]] and [[#ClientID_and_Secret|Secret]]. *invalid_accesstoken - The [[#Access_Token|Access Token]] ([[#api.php|api_s]]) passed from the client is no longer valid. Solution: Call [[VB4 API:api init|api_init]] (with [[#api.php|api_c]] parameter) to get a new Access Token. clientID and Secret won\u0026rsquo;t be changed. *invalid_api_signature - The [[#API_Method_Request_and_Return_Result_Verification|Signature]] passed to [[#api.php|api.php]] is invalid. *missing_api_signature - Every method except [[VB5_API:api.init|api.init]] requires [[#API_Method_Request_and_Return_Result_Verification|Signature]]. If the client doesn\u0026rsquo;t pass a signature, this error will happen. *bbclosed - Forum is closed. *toobusy - Forum is temporarily closed due to server load average.\nSupported Methods For the list of methods that the client can call, please see [[VB5_MAPI/API_Methods|MAPI Methods in vB5]]\nOther Documentations *[[VB5_API_Explain:Login/Logout Process|Login/Logout Process]] *[[VB5_MAPI/API_Methods|MAPI Methods in vB5]] *[[VB5_API_Common_Array:Postbits_Array|Postbits Array in vB5]]\n[[Category:vB5_How_Tos]]\n"},{"id":90,"href":"/developers/interfaces/","title":"Interfaces","parent":"Developers","content":"vBulletin offers the following access interfaces:\nWeb MAPI Local "},{"id":91,"href":"/administration/AdminCP/languages/managing_languages/","title":"Managing Languages","parent":"Languages \u0026 Phrases","content":"Path to Managing Languages: Languages \u0026amp; Phrases \u0026gt; Language Manager.\nThis screen lists all languages you have installed.

Most shared-environment hosting providers meet these qualifications already. If you\u0026rsquo;re unsure, you can always use vBulletin Cloud to host your vBulletin website.\nMinimum Requirements vBulletin is a web-based application and as such has a few minimum requirements. To run vBulletin, you need a web hosting provider that includes the following on their systems:\nPHP version: 7.4.0 MySQL version: 5.7 As an alternative to MySQL, you can use MariaDB version 10.3. A pre-registered domain name 200 Megabytes of hard drive space Rewrite Engine â A rewrite engine is needed for vBulletin\u0026rsquo;s Friendly URL routing to work. Popular rewrite engines include mod_rewrite on Apache 2.4+ and \u0026ldquo;URL Rewrite\u0026rdquo; for IIS 7+. MySQLi support â MySQLi is a more robust software library to connect to the database that vBulletin uses. mbstring library - A PHP library that helps with character conversion for UTF-8 support. iconv library â A PHP library that provides extra language and character set support. Recommended Requirements The following settings and software packages are not required but will make your vBulletin experience more enjoyable. Your hosting provider can tell you whether these are available on your server.\nPHP 8.0 or higher. MySQL 8.0 or greater. cURL or OpenSSL support â Allows secure connections to third-party services like Facebook Connect. OpCode Cache â An OpCode Cache like APC or XCache will enhance the performance of your vBulletin software. An OpCode Cache is a caching mechanism that can significantly increase the performance of vBulletin by pre-parsing the PHP files and keeping commonly used data in memory for rapid retrieval. Sphinx Search A minimum version of Sphinx 2.4.2 is required to use Sphinx Search instead of MySQL for keyword based searches.\nBrowser Support Chromium-based Browsers (Examples: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi) Apple Safari for MacOS and iPadOS. Mozilla Firefox. A desktop class browser is necessary to administrate and modify your vBulletin Software.

In vBulletin 5 Connect, we\u0026rsquo;ve eliminated the redundancy this caused and that has required some new terms to be introduced.\nvBulletin Site This refers to your vBulletin 5 Connect installation including all of its content, pages and users. Forum Root This is the directory that you installed vBulletin 5 Connect in. In most cases this with by public_html. Presentation Layer A layer of vBulletin 5 Connect that draws the pages for the web interface or what users see when they visit using a Web Browser. Mobile Layer Interface that allows the Mobile Apps to retrieve information from the vBulletin installation. This layer is built into the Mobile App and communicates to the Core Layer via APIs. Core Layer The core layer of vBulletin 5 Connect. This interface layer talks with the database and API to provide all the data. It is called from the Presentation and Mobile Layers. Other Concepts What are Channels? Channels are Nodes that can contain other Nodes. In vBulletin 5, Channels include: Forums, Articles, Blogs, Social Groups, Private Messages, Visitor Messages, User Albums, and Flagged (reported) Content. Additional Channels may be added in the future. Some channels can be maintained with the Channel Management (formerly Forum Management) tools in the Admin CP. Others are hidden from view and maintained by the individual users. What are Nodes? Nodes are any content within vBulletin 5. They can be discussions, photos, links or channels among other content types. Generally speaking you will refer to nodes by their content type. What are Content Types? Content Types allow your users to control how their contributions are presented to others. These can be Photo Galleries, Links, Polls, or Text. Each content type can be used to create topics on the site. As the Administrator, you control the content types that are available to users through permissions. What is a Channel Owner? The user that has ownership of a channel. They control what happens in the channel itself. Blogs and Social Groups are examples of channels that can have owners. What is a Channel Moderator? A user appointed by the Channel Owner to moderate that channel. Blogs and Social Groups are examples of channels that can have moderators. What is a Channel User? Some channels can be made private. A Channel User is an individual that has permission to access a specific channel. Social Groups are an example of channels that have users. What are Subscribers?

So after this API call user.login2, client should call api.init to get the new securitytoken. Once the client gains both the new sessionhash and the securitytoken, please save them in application session vars. And then login process is done. You need to pass the new sessionhash to the API and use the new securitytoken to sign the requests in future API method calls.\nLogout Process Client should call user.logout to logout an user. And it will return a new session hash just the same as user.login2.\nClient don\u0026rsquo;t need to fetch a new apiaccesstoken again because after logging out, the new security token is always be \u0026lsquo;guest\u0026rsquo;.

The default is called \u0026ldquo;DB Search\u0026rdquo; and is an indexed implementation stored in a number of tables within your database. This will allow you to search all content types marked as \u0026ldquo;Searchable\u0026rdquo; when they are created/installed in your system.\nThe second search implementation uses Sphinx Search. Sphinx is an open source full text search server, designed from the ground up with performance, relevance (aka search quality), and integration simplicity in mind. It\u0026rsquo;s written in C++ and works on Linux (RedHat, Ubuntu, etc), Windows, MacOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, and a few other systems. To use this search engine, please see the instructions on Installing Sphinx.\nYou may be able to find alternative search engines from third-party vendors or possibly at http://www.vbulletin.org.\nChanging search implementations will require you to rebuild the search index before the search function will return results. For the DB Search this can be done via Maintenance \u0026gt; General Update Counters. The reindex can take a long time for large boards. Some high performance search engines may provide a faster alternate method of doing a full reindex, consult the documentation provided with your search type. Consult the documentation for your search type to learn how to rebuild the search index for it.\nIndexed Search This is the default search type used by vBulletin. When new content is created, it split up into individual words and indexed into various search tables. Words less than 4 characters are not indexed. Sub-words are not indexed separately. This search type does not have any separate configuration options.\nSphinx Search Sphinx is designed for Advanced Users only. Knowledge of configuring and maintaining Server Platforms is a requirement.\nBelow you will find the instructions for installing the Sphinx Search Daemon on your server and how to configure it to work with vBulletin.\nInstall Sphinx on your server Login as root Download Sphinx.

This section covers software we recommend for use that is tried and tested in working with vBulletin.\nText Editors There may be times in vBulletin where youâll be required to edit or make changes to PHP, html or JS files. Most operating systems come with one or more text editors. However, you may need more functionality than those basic applications. Here are some text editors that we recommend.\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Code - This is a robust text editor with many extensions and color themes available. It uses the Electron platform as its base and is available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Sublime Text 2 - Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose. Notepad++ - Notepad++ is a free (as in \u0026ldquo;free speech\u0026rdquo; and also as in \u0026ldquo;free beer\u0026rdquo;) source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages. EmEditor - A text editor for windows and large files. This editor will allow you to open multi-gigabyte files with ease. TextWrangler - Is a code editor that is free for use in Apple OS X. It also has a big brother BBEdit. BBEdit - BBEdit is the big brother of TextWrangler. It has more features than its sibling. You can compare them here. GNU Nano - Nano is an easy to use text editor especially for both new and advanced Linux users. It enhances usability by providing customizable key binding. SFTP Client While using vBulletin youâre going to need a way to get files onto your server, for this you will need an FTP Client. Most operating systems come with a command line FTP utility. However, you might want to use something with a GUI.\nFilezilla - Filezilla is a full featured FTP client that is capable of running on all modern operating systems. If you do not have a specific ftp client you like already, Filezilla ends up being the best choice for features, functionality, and cost. CyberDuck - Cyberduck is a libre FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, S3, Backblaze B2, Azure \u0026amp; OpenStack Swift browser for Mac and Windows. CuteFTP - The worldâs favorite secure FTP client is better than ever. From mobility to global communication to top-notch SFTP-ready security, CuteFTPÂ® does it all! WinSCP - WinSCP is an open source free SFTP client, FTP client, WebDAV client and SCP client for Windows. Its main function is file transfer between a local and a remote computer. Beyond this, WinSCP offers scripting and basic file manager functionality. SSH SSH allows you to connect to the terminal of your server. This is another utility that is available on most modern operating systems.\nPutty SSH - PuTTY is an SSH and telnet client, developed originally by Simon Tatham for the Windows platform. PuTTY is open source software that is available with source code and is developed and supported by a group of volunteers. vSSH - vSSH is advanced customizable SSH and Telnet client with iCloud connections and macros sharing. MySQL / MariaDB Access vBulletin stores all of its data in a MySQL or MariaDB database. Being able to access the database directly allows you to create or restore backups and could be useful for fixing some issues. Your server\u0026rsquo;s MySQL or MariaDB installation will come with a command-line tool that allows access via SSH. If you do not have SSH, then you\u0026rsquo;ll want to use one of these tools.\nMySQL Workbench - MySQL Workbench is a unified visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and much more. MySQL Workbench is available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. This requires remote access for your database server. HeidiSQL - HeidiSQL is a useful and reliable tool designed for web developers using the popular MySQL server, Microsoft SQL databases and PostgreSQL. phpMyAdmin - Web-based phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL and MariaDB. Adminer - Web-based Adminer (formerly phpMinAdmin) is a full-featured database management tool written in PHP. This is a single file alternative to phpMyAdmin. Remote Access GUI Sometimes, support will need to connect to your server. If you cannot make server access available via SSH or SFTP, then one of these methods may be used.\nWindows Remote Desktop - Feature available to Windows Professional, Enterprise and Server versions. Allows direct connection and control over other machines. TeamViewer - Establish incoming and outgoing remote connections for real-time support or access to other computers. Participate in meetings and presentations, chat with other people or groups, and make video calls as well. After downloading and installing this software, you will have your first session up and running within seconds. TightVNC - TightVNC is a free remote control software package. With TightVNC, you can see the desktop of a remote machine and control it with your local mouse and keyboard, just like you would do it sitting in the front of that computer. Requires JAVA for Mac and Linux use. GoToMeeting - Web-based Online meeting and screensharing tool that can be helpful in support situations.

Using these tags, you can retrieve information, format, and display it on the user\u0026rsquo;s web client.\n"},{"id":119,"href":"/administration/AdminCP/vbulletin_api/","title":"vBulletin API","parent":"AdminCP (Control Panel)","content":""},{"id":120,"href":"/administration/AdminCP/settings/Options/third-party-login-options/","title":"Third Party Login Options","parent":"Options","content":" Enable Sign-in with Twitter Enabling this option will allow users to connect their vBulletin account with their Twitter account, and use their Twitter credentials to log-in to the forum.\nVariable Name: twitterlogin_enabled Data Type: boolean Default Value: 1 Enable Registration with Twitter Enabling this option will allow users to connect their Twitter account while creating their vB user account.

The vBulletin phrase system makes its templates language independent so you can display pages in multiple languages using a single style.\nEach phrase (for example, âpasswordâ or âone hour agoâ) can have a translation for every language specified in this Language Manager. When a channel page is loaded, vBulletin checks what language the current logged-in user has selected, looks up the phrase variables in that language, and replaces them with the appropriate translated text.\nIn addition to translated phrases, vBulletin\u0026rsquo;s language system supports translated images (by allowing you to override a style\u0026rsquo;s images folder setting), and language-specific date/time/number formats.\nThe topics in this section cover what you need to know to localize your vBulletin site.\nThe difference between a Language and Phrases Within vBulletin, a language is a container that sets up the support of a different language. This includes options like right-to-left, the HTML Character Set, the PHP Locale, and any specific data and time formatting overrides.\nPhrases are the individual strings of text that make up the user interface. Sometimes multiple phrases will be needed to create a specific output string. This is due to variations in how languages handle gender, numbers, and other specific rules that may come up.\nThe \u0026lsquo;Master Language\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Custom Master Language\u0026rsquo; Regardless of any languages you enable as administrator (for example, Spanish or German) there are always two that always exist in vBulletin: the Master Language and the Custom Master Language. They are generally protected from being directly edited.\nThe Master Language is where all of vBulletinâs untranslated, default phrases exist. It is important to have the original version of all phrases available for reference purposes. You cannot directly edit these language phrases.\nThe Custom Master Language contains only custom phrases you have created, which can be accessed as if they were part of the Master Language.\nPhrase Syntax The many phrase variable names in vBulletin have their values stored as strings when vBulletin\u0026rsquo;s cached language data is generated or regenerated.\nFor example, the phrase variable show_all_users is stored as Show All Users, and additional_options is stored as Additional Options.\nSometimes the strings contain substitution variables that are not replaced with specific values until runtime.\nFor example, the phrase variable showing_avatars_x_to_y_of_z is stored as the following string with substitution variables {1}, {2}, and {3}:\nShowing Avatars {1} to {2} of {3} At runtime, the string might contain the values 10, 20, and 24 in place of {2}, and {3}:\nShowing Avatars 10 to 20 of 24. Suppose you wanted the output string to look like the following:\n24 Avatars Total. Displaying 10 - 20. You could accomplish that by changing the string to the following:\n{3} Avatars Total. Displaying {1} - {2}. As you can see, the order of the substitution variables can be changed. The important thing is that you reference the correct substitution variable number for the output variable you want.\nUsing Phrases in Templates Phrases are generally straightforward to use in templates. Simple phrases (without any variable portions) can be referenced like regular $variables; complex phrases are referenced similarly to template conditionals. When referencing a phrase in a template, you need to know the following information:\nThe phrase name (phrase_name) The phrase name is what uniquely identifies a phrase and how phrases are referenced. Generally, the phrase name reflects the phrase text directly; for example, the phrase with variable name poll_timeout has the text of Poll Timeout. The phrase group If the phrase is in a group, you can access it only on pages that load that group.\nUsing Phrases To use a phrase in a template, you need to use the following constructs.\nphrase - {vb:phrase phrase_name[, arguments for phrase...]} Inserts the specified phrase. If arguments are provided, they will be run through htmlspecialchars().\nExample: {vb:phrase welcome}\nrawphrase - {vb:rawphrase phrase_name[, arguments for phrase...]} Inserts the specified phrase, but arguments bypass htmlspecialchars().\nExample: {vb:rawphrase message_by_x_on_y_at_z, {vb:link member, {vb:raw postinfo}}, {vb:raw postinfo.username}, {vb:raw postinfo.postdate}, {vb:raw postinfo.posttime}}\nFor more information about template syntax, see \u0026laquo;\u0026raquo;.\n"},{"id":129,"href":"/end_user_guide/managing_groups/","title":"Managing Groups","parent":"End User Guide","content":""},{"id":130,"href":"/administration/AdminCP/settings/Options/privacy-options/","title":"Privacy Options","parent":"Options","content":" Enable Privacy Consent for Guests This will require all users in the selected locations to consent to information tracking in order to use the site.

For example, adding 243.21.11 will allow 243.21.11.7 to register. However, 243.21.115.7 would still not be able to register. You may also use an \u0026lsquo;\u0026rsquo; as a wildcard for increased flexibility. For example, if you enter 243.21.11, many IPs will be allowed to register, including: 243.21.11.7, 243.21.115.7, 243.21.119.225.

If this is your first time using one of our products (or vBulletin 5), this guide will help you get things set up. Letâs begin with a few definitions.\nWhen you first install your vBulletin, your site loads with the preset style and page like so:\nAs you can see, itâs already been pre-populated with a page and some modules. A page is exactly that, a page. It displays your site to users and is a container for modules. Modules are pieces of functionality that you can add, customize, and, sometimes, remove from a page. These modules can cover such functionality as displaying ads, to announcements, to videos and even videos.\nEverything displayed in vBulletin 5 is a Module of some type. There are two types of modules: normal modules and system modules. The main difference between the two is that youâre unable to delete system modules. This is functionality that you wouldnât want removed from your site to begin with, such as private messages, advanced search and registration forms.\nNow that we have the basic terms down for vBulletin 5, weâll move on to the how they work and how you can use them, starting with creating pages.\nTable of Content Introduction Editing and Creating Pages Add Modules Tab Change Layout Tab Select Template Tab Color Style Tab Saving the Changes Adding a Page Linking to the a New Page Creating Your First Forum and Subforum Adding a Forum Creating a Category Adding a Sub-Forum Creating a Private Forum Setting Up User Registration Setting Up Human Verification FAQ How do I change my username? How do I change my password? How do I change my logo? How do I change the default style? How do I add my own ads? 4\nEditing and Creating Pages You can edit all default pages in addition to adding more pages to meet the needs of your site. In order to edit an existing page, activate the Site Builder by click on the the toggle button in the upper right hand corner of your navigation bar. Once youâve activated the Site Builder function, navigate to the page that you want to edit and click Edit Page button. You may asked to re-enter your password for security purposes. Using Site Builder will change the look and feel of your site dramatically and this is to ensure that authorized users can do this. Once you have been authenticated, a form like the one below will open.\nAdd Module The first (the Add Modules) is a catalogue of modules that you can add to the selected page to customize the look and feel of it. Each, as we mentioned, has a different function. Hereâs a short list of some of the modules you may want to use:\nAd - A module that organizes and rotates the ads on a site. Container Module - A module that other modules are moved into so regular users can interact with them but moving or minimizing its contents. Online Users - A modules that displays the number of users online at any given time. Search - A module that displays a set of search results as a list on a page. The results can be customized. Static HTML - A module that displays custom HTML. Tag Cloud - A module that displays a clickable list of tags used on the site. Todayâs Birthday - A module that displays the usernames of userâs with birthdays on any given day. Top Active Users - A module that displays a list of the top active users. Video - A module that embeds a video on to a page. To put a module on a page, click and drag it from the menu onto the page itself. You can use the same method to rearrange the order of the modules on a page. To delete a module, click on the trash can icon to the right of the module title. To edit the module, click on the pencil. A form will open similar to the one below:\nA number of fields will be available in the form for you to edit and change. To save the changes you have made for the module, click on the Save button at the bottom of the dialog.\nChange Layout The Change Layout Tab is the second of the four tabs. This controls the number of columns on a page and the percentage of space each column takes up.\nSelect Template Tab Templates are the saved designs for the default pages and any pages that you create. This can be especially helpful when you have several pages using the same template that requires a change that affects them all.\nColor Style The Color Style Tab allows access to the limited ability to change or create a new style for the Site. Using a combination of the color wheel and the My Color Palette, you have a limited control over how the page looks like. A preview of the page will appear beneath the form and the save button in the left hand column allows you to save the Style youâve created to reuse at a later date.\nSaving the Changes Once youâre finished modifying the page, click on the Save Page button to the right of the tabs. It opens a confirmation form where you have the option of saving the page as a new Template or overwriting the existing Template.\nIf you choose to overwrite the existing Template, you wonât be able to retrieve the old design if you want to switch back at a later time.\nAdding a Page To add a page to your site, follow the same steps as we listed at the top of this section, but! Instead of clicking on the Edit Page button, click on the New Page button instead.\nLinking to the a New Page To link your newly created page in the navigation bar, navigate to the page and copy the address to your clipboard. Click on the Navigation Bar button. A form like the one below will open:\nDecide if you want the link to be a main navigation item or a sub-navigation item. If the link is a sub-navigation item, click on the carat to the far right of the main navigation item you want it nested beneath. Click either the New Navigation Item or the New Sub Navigation Item.\nEnter in the name of the link in the Navigation Item Name field and then paste the address your copied into the Target URL before clicking the Save button. Once thatâs one, your link will appear in column it was added to. To change itâs position, click and drag it to its new location. Finally, click Save Changes and confirm your changes. If you do not take this step, the changes will be lost.\nCreating Your First Forum and Subforum Your vBulletin installation comes with a pre-generated forum. To add more forums, turn on your Site Builder and click on the Page Manager button. This opens a form like the one below:\nAdding a Forum From here, enter the name of the of forum you want to create in the New Forum text box and click Add. It will appear beneath the pre-generated Main Forum. You can change itâs position by clicking on the dotted strip to the left of the forum name and dragging it to its new location. If you want to delete the forum, click the red x icon to the right of the plus symbol. A confirmation popup will appear. Clicking Yes will complete the deletion. Be careful of which forums you delete, since any threads, posts, and replies in that forum will be removed along with its parent.\nCreating a Category A category is a container for forums and largely used to organize the forums into, well, different categories. To make a category, click on the Make Category link to the right of the forum you wish to be a category. It will be instantly changed to a category. If you want to change it back, just click the Make Forum link that has taken itâs place. Itâs that simple.\nAdding a Sub-Forum Sub-forums are forums that are nested in parent forums. Usually, this is used to create an area for specific aspects of the topic covered by the larger forum to be discussed. If you want to create sub-forum, click on the plus symbol between the Make Category link and the red x icon. A field such as as the one below will appear:\nEnter the name of the new forum in the field that reads New Channel before clicking away from the sub-forum. Itâs that simple.\nCreating a Private Channel More advanced functionality such as permissions are handled in the AdminCP. Now that you have your forums set up, you might want to change the permissions on them. Permissions tell the system which users get to see what. By using permissions, you can create a private forum for your users to use.\nTo do this, click on the AdminCP button in the upper right hand corner of the Site Builder menu.\nPlease note, you may be asked to log in again for the same reasons that you had to provide your password a second time. The window will reload to a page similar to this:\nScroll down to the Channel Management header and click it. Select the Channel Permissions option and click it.\nFor a more thorough explanation of permissions, go here: https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_permission_overview_overview\nThis will reload the frame to the right with a form like this:\nSelect the Edit link beside the usergroup you want to hide the forum from. This will open another form with several options:\nFind the Channel Permissions header and change the Can View Forum setting to No before clicking Save. The usergroup that you selected will no longer be able to see that Channel.\nSetting Up User Registration With everything set up for your site, itâs now time to take a look at your User Registration settings. Stay in the AdminCP and click on the Settings header, followed by the Options link.\nOnce the vBulletin Options form loads, select the User Registration Options from the scrolling list and click the Edit Settings button. The following form will load:\nThis controls every aspect of user registration for your site. It includes everything from whether or not itâs turned on, to COPPA Registration, to Welcome Messages. For a full list of options and what they do, go to: https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_settings_options_userregistration\nSetting Up Human Verification There are some sections of the site and its functionality that youâll want to have human verification for. To turn on Human Verification, click on the Settings header in the AdminCP, followed by the Options link. Once the vBulletin Options form loads, select the Human Verification Options from the scrolling list and click the Edit Settings button: This reloads the frame with the following form:\nChecking an option will activate it, while unchecking the option will deactivate it. This means that any usergroup that has the option Require Human Verification on Configure Actions activated will need to verify that theyâre human when interacting with the selected options. Once youâre done, click Save and the changes youâve made will be applied to the site.\nFrequently Asked Questions How do I change my username? To change your username, login to the AdminCP and click on the Users header. In the menu, click on Search for Users. In the new form in the frame to the right, enter your current username in to the User Name field and click the Exact Match button. In the User Form, change the username in the User Name field and click Save. How do I change my password? On your Site Home Page, click on the Profile tab. Find the Edit Settings button beneath your user picture and click on it. This will reload the page with the Profile Settings page. Click on the Account tab and scroll down to the Password fields. Enter your current password in the field with the words âEnter current passwordâ and your new password in both the fields below that. Click Save Changes and your password will be set to the new password. How do I change my logo? To change the logo of your site, make sure your Site Builder is turned on and click the Header button in the menu. Find the vBulletin logo and click the Edit button in the upper left hand corner. This will open an upload form which you can use to replace the current logo with another of your liking. Once youâve uploaded the new logo, click on the Save Changes button. The site will reload with the new logo. How do I change the default style? There are two methods to do this: Open the Quick Setup page within Site Builder. Select a Style from the listed Themes. This will become the default style for your site. This can be done in the AdminCP. To change the default style for a page, login to the AdminCP and click on the Settings header. Then click on Options then select the Styles \u0026 Language Settings option from the new form. This will take you to the selected form. From here, find the Default Styles section and select a new default style from the dropdown list. Click the Save button at the bottom of the form and your changes will be saved. How do I add my own ads? To add your own ads, turn on the Site Builder option and add the Ad Module to the page you want the ads to appear on. Click on the Edit button for the module and fill out the form before clicking Attach. This will take you to a new form where you can arrange the order in which the ads appear or add new ads.\nOnce youâre done, click the Save button on the Ad form and confirm the changes on the page by clicking the Save Page button. The ads should now appear where you placed them.

Warning: vBulletin allows any valid HTML tags here, so be sure not to include any tags that could potentially break your layout or allow site abuse. You can use the special variables {userid}, {username}, {musername} and {sessionurl} in the HTML to personalize the notice text. For example, Hello, {username}, how are you? is replaced in the actual notice by Hello, John Doe, how are you? when John Doe is logged on.\nHere is a more complex example, making use of the {sessionurl} variable to make links within the site work properly: Hello, {musername]. \u0026lt;a href=âmember.php?{sessionurl}u={userid}âView Your Profile Display Order The Display Order text box controls the order in which the notices are shown, both in the Notices Manager and to visitors.

To start the process, you need to create a new template to hold your custom HTML code.\nIn the AdminCP go to Styles â Style Manager. Select your style row and go to the Choose Action drop down. Note: If you are creating a product (see below), you should choose the MASTER STYLE which will be in the list while the site is in Debug Mode. Select \u0026ldquo;Add New Template\u0026rdquo; from the drop down. Add your custom code. Give the template a name. Something like \u0026ldquo;display_linkedin_share\u0026rdquo; would be appropriate but it can be anything you want. Save this new template. If you use multiple templates, then repeat for each style or create a product to hold the template in the MASTER STYLE (see below) Building the hook In order to show your new template it needs to be tied to a template hook. These are small pieces of code within vBulletin that tells the system to find and include any template at specific locations. For a share button, the hook that you want to use is conversation_share.\nGo to Products and Hooks â Manage Templates Hooks Click on \u0026ldquo;Add New Hook\u0026rdquo; If using a Product (see below) select your product from the drop down. Set the Hook Location to \u0026ldquo;conversation_sharing\u0026rdquo; Give it a name like \u0026ldquo;LinkedIn Share\u0026rdquo; or whatever you want. Set the template name to the template that you created above. Save the Hook. This should give you a working link in each post. If you want to style it like the others then look at the b-sharing-menu* CSS in the default templates. Creating a Product Note: This creating Products is not available on vBulletin Cloud. However, the other portions can be completed on vBulletin Cloud.\nProducts allow you to apply more permanence to your changes. When you upgrade vBulletin, there is a possibility for your changes to be erased because they are assigned to the vBulletin product by default. During an upgrade, some parts of the system are replaced with new objects. This includes unedited templates, phrases, settings, and permissions.\nCreating your own product provides a wrapper that protects your customizations. A product also allows you to easily apply your changes to every style or language, even ones added in the future.\nPut your site into Debug Mode Go to Products \u0026amp; Hooks. Click Add New Product. Give it a Product ID. All lower case, no spaces. Give it a title. The rest is optional. Save your Product. Complete the steps for creating a template and hook above.

Once you make your choice, we cannot change it. Make sure that you are happy with the choice you make.\nUsing a previously registered domain name. With vBulletin Cloud, you can choose a custom domain name if you are the registrer of that name. Within the Cloud system, we will use a subdomain such as www.example.com or forum.example.com. This is handled by a CNAME Record that is created at your domain registrar or the hosting provider of your main website.\nSubdomains must be at least two characters long Managing your CNAME Record Updating your CNAME record allows you to point your custom domain (e.g. myvbulletincloud.com) to the sub-domain assigned to your account. In order to do this youâll need to visit your domain name registrar and update the records on their site. If you are also using the domain for a regular site, youâll need to redirect a sub-domain (e.g. forums.myvbulletincloud.com).\nTo add a CNAME record:\nLogin into your domain name registrarâs management panel.

The system allows you to build custom community sites without coding. Community driven content management allows for content that is always fresh and relevent. Using vBulletin allows you to engage your users in content creation, collation and distribution. vBulletin 5 has been designed to bring you modern community building and ease of use.\nSelf-Hosted vs. vBulletin Cloud There are two different ways that you can utilize vBulletin on your site. These are the Self-Hosted and vBulletin Cloud installations. There are pros and cons to either implementation.\nSelf-Hosted: This installation type requires more technical knowledge on your part. You will be responsible for maintaining your server, upgrading vBulletin and the overall security of your server. In exchange for these requirements, you will have full access to the source code, can modify all templates, and install third-party products. vBulletin Cloud: When using the Cloud version of vBulletin, you won\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about server maintenance, server security, or upgrading vBulletin. However, the tradeoff is that you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to customize the software as much. People who run vBulletin Cloud sites, cannot edit most templates, upload third-party products, or access the source code the site. You can see a detailed comparison of the features between these options on the vBulletin website.\nFeatures Site Builder One of the new features of vBulletin 5 Connect is Site Builder Site Builder is a new way to build and manage your sites. It features drag and drop technology to enable you to build custom pages that fit your needs quickly and easily. Site Builder also includes a Style Generator so you can quickly and easily create a new styles with custom color combinations.\nEverything is Content In vBulletin 5, weâve developed an idea that everything is content. This is built around a new content model involving channels, nodes and the actual content. In this model everything works the same, everything is searchable and everything provides a modern input system. Adding new content should be more intuitive for your users.\nNew Themes vBulletin 5 is customizable through the use of Styles and Language Packs. Styles are made up of HTML and CSS which you can customize within the Administrator Control Panel. Language Packs allow you to translate the text of the user interface to any language.\nvBulletin Messenger Live real-time private chat for your members. Chats can be one-on-one or with small groups of people. Each chat is held in its own interface to keep things separate and allow action on other parts of the site at the same.\nResponsive Design People are using devices of many different sizes these days. These include phones, tablets and ultra-high density monitors. Weâve included a responsive design in vBulletin 5 that scales to the device being used. No more worrying about mobile styles and trying to configure things for multiple devices. vBulletin adjusts to the screen-size of the userâs device automatically.\n"},{"id":190,"href":"/vbulletin_cloud/migrate_to_cloud/","title":"Migrating Existing Site.","parent":"vBulletin Cloud","content":"We can migrate your existing vBulletin site to vBulletin Cloud. This service is available for vBulletin 3, vBulletin 4, and vBulletin 5. When we migrate your site, we will also update it to the latest version of vBulletin currently available. The migration includes users, all user data, forums/channels, topics and replies. Once migration is completed, you will be able to select one of the provided themes or design your own.\nPlease note that any custom styles from vBulletin 3 and 4 will not be usable. Add-on Products will not be migrated. Add-on products are not compatible with vBulletin Cloud. Starting Your Migration To get started with your migration, you will need to purchase the migration service and open a support ticket with the following information:\nUser ID of your Admin User. This is the user number and is needed for the importer to operate properly. Any prefix the vBulletin tables have in your database Whether or not you\u0026rsquo;ve create style customizations on your cloud site already. Providing Your Backup. In order to perform this service, the support representative will need access to your database backup. See Create a Database Backup for more information. If your attachments and avatars are stored in the file system, we will need a backup of these files as well. We accept backups in ZIP and GZIP formats. They should not be double compressed. If your attachments are stored in the database and your database is larger than 1 Gigabyte in size, the attachments should be moved to the file system.\nThe file(s) should be named as follows:\nDatabase: database_{sitename}_{year}{month}{day}.extension Attachments: attachments_{sitename}_attachments_{year}{month}{day}.extension Avatars: avatars_{sitename}_{year}{month}{day}.extension Files should be made available via SFTP or as a shared link leading to your favorite cloud storage site.\nProcessing Your Migration Once the support representative has access to your backups, they will upload them to the server and start the process. Depending on the size of your site and any pre-existing modifications you had made previously, this can take several hours to a couple of days. Most only take three to four hours to process but situations can arise while this is occurring.\nAny changes made to a vBulletin Cloud site will be lost if a subsequent migration is performed. We cannot merge sites at this time. We will process up to two migrations for your site. The first migration can be seen used a test. The second will be considered final. Due to this, the vBulletin site that you are migrating should be turned off during this process.

Many of these variables will exist with default values in the file as it ships but this isn\u0026rsquo;t required for all of them. Changing these values will affect how your vBulletin site operates.\nNote: Many of the variables listed here will have additional documentation in the/core/includes/config.php file.\nEditing the config.php file Everything to the left of the equal (=) sign will define the variable and should not be changed. When making any changes to the file, the edit should always be to the right of the equal (=) sign between the single quotes.\nDefault: $config['MasterServer']['username'] = 'root'; Good Example: $config['MasterServer']['username'] = 'myuser'; Bad Example: $config['MasterServer']['myuser'] = 'root'; Comments Some lines will require you to remove comment indicators. Comments are special blocks of code that the server will ignore when processing the vBulletin files. Comments come in two formats:\n//: A comment for that line only. To remove delete the // from the beginning of the line. \\* *\\: Comments out a block of code. Deleting both the leading \\* and the ending *\\ will remove the comment. Improperly removing comments can cause fatal processing errors in vBulletin.\nCookies Prefix that all vBulletin cookies will have. Keep this short and only use numbers and letters, i.e. 1-9 and a-Z.
